# Fifa 21 Project - Week2 Day 1 and 2 and then some....
Group Fifa Project

This project brings together cleaning and prepping data, implementing a linear regression model, x/y testing and cross validation.

It contains 3 models, the main, cheeky and test.

- The main is using many of the columns to create our model and can be tweaked to test different outcomes. R Score of around 0.9
- Cheeky model is creating a new column taking the max of the scores and using that as the only feature. R Score of around 0.97/0.98
- Cheat model was a test taking the target as the feature. R Score is as expected: 1, MSE is not exactly 0 due to rounding

It is a bit of a mess with extra code, commented out code and checks, opted to leave these in for now.
